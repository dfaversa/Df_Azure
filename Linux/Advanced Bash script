## Week 6 Homework Submission File: Advanced Bash - Owning the System




**Step 1: Shadow People**

1. Create a secret user named `sysd`. Make sure this user doesn't have a home folder created:
	- `Your solution command here` adduser sysd

2. Give your secret user a password:
	- `Your solution command here` passwd sysd
		
3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
	- `Your solution command here` usermod -u 333 sysd
		
4. Give your secret user the same GID:
   - `Your solution command here` groupmod -g 333 sysd
				 				
5. Give your secret user full `sudo` access without the need for a password:
   -  `Your solution command here`                 	       	 

6. Test that `sudo` access works without your password:

	```bash
	Your bash commands here: sudo -l
	```

**Step 2: Smooth Sailing**

1. Edit the `sshd_config` file:

	```bash
	Your bash commands here: 
	```

**Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update**
1. Restart the SSH service:
	- `Your solution command here`

2. Exit the `root` account:
	- `Your solution command here` 
3. SSH to the target machine using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:
	- `Your solution command here`

4. Use `sudo` to switch to the root user:
	- `Your solution command here` 

**Step 4: Crack All the Passwords**

1. SSH back to the system using your `sysd` account and port `2222`:

	- `Your solution command here`  

2. Escalate your privileges to the `root` user. Use John to crack the entire `/etc/shadow` file:

	- `Your solution command here` sudo john /etc/shadow
